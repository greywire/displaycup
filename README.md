# Project Title

This is the code for the Display Cup build shown on Instructables website. It is using Arduino and ESP32 libraries, built using PlatformIO.

## Getting Started

You should be able to easily install the Atom editor with PlatformIO extensions to build this.

### Prerequisites

An ESP32 and Waveshare E-ink display hat and display.

## Contributing

I welcome any contributions from anyone who decides to build one. I have also thought about how to actually manufacture a more functional cup either for a kit or for commercial sale.
